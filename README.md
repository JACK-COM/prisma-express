# üöÑ *Prisma-Express*

A lightweight `Node`-`Typescript`-`Express`-`Prisma` quick-starter with semi-advanced user authentication (see dependencies).\
Forked from [**AWallace's version**](https://github.com/vawallace/base-node-express).

## Getting Started

### Setup Environment Variables
1. Create a new file `{ProjectRoot}/.env` 
2. Copy Contents from `{ProjectRoot}/env.sample` 
3. (OPTIONAL) Run `npm run generate-keys` to generate random values for the `JWT_SEC` and `ENCRYPT` constants.

### Setup Database
Don't worry: this part is easy.

First, create a database using one of Prisma's supported providers.\
The repository author prefers `postgresql`, though Prisma also supports `mysql`, `sqlite`, `sqlserver` and `mongodb`.\
Then you can follow the next steps:
1. Set the `DB_URL` variable in your `.env` file to your new database.\
   The end result should look something like this (configured for postgres):
   ```
   DB_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name"
   ```
2. **Check the `schema.prisma` file**. It only contains model definitions for a single `Users` table.\
   You can alter the table to your liking, and/or add more tables. Take care of this part before syncing the database.
   > The `schema.prisma` file can be changed often. However, breaking changes may wipe your seed data if you use `prisma db push`, so this is a good
   > time to be reckless.
   >
   > (OPTIONAL) **If you aren't using `postgresql`**, update the `provider` of the `datasource` block in schema.prisma to match your database provider. Remember Prisma also supports `mysql`, `sqlite`, `sqlserver` and `mongodb`.

   
And you're done!
   

### Add NPM dependencies
Install NPM dependencies.
```bash
$. npm install 
```

## Running
Run the project on `localhost:4001`:
```bash
$. npm run start
```
You can change the port by providing a different `PORT` environment variable.

When you run `start`,
   1. A prisma migration script will compare the connected database to the `schema.prisma` file
   2. If differences are found, relevant migrations will be created and applied.

If you are not using a database (or don't want this behavior), remove the "prestart" script from `package.json`


## Build
Generate a build artifact:
```bash
$. npm run build
```
Outputs to `/lib`. You can test it locally by running `node lib/server.js`.


## Table Changes and Database Migrations 
To add (or change) your database: 
1. Modify the `schema.prisma` file (add tables/columns/etc) and save your changes
2. Restart the app. Migrations will be automatically applied.

> ### ‚ö†Ô∏è Careful when adding Enums
> Database enums should not be created and applied as a default value in the same migration. 
> 
> To avoid this:
> 1. Add your new enum (or enum property) and trigger migrations.
> 2. Deploy the new enum/enum property to your production environment. 
> 3. Apply the new enum (or enum value) as a default column value, and trigger migrations again. 
> 
> This helps to prevent one source of silent migration failures.

## Dependencies
This repository comes with the following (in no particular order):

1. [Prisma](https://pris.ly/d/getting-started)\
  (Code-first database ORM)
2. [PassportJS](http://www.passportjs.org/docs/)\
  (authentication via google and username/password only; you can implement more)
3. [Apollo server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server) 
4. [NexusJS (for GraphQL)](https://nexusjs.org/)\
  (Code-first schema generation for graphql)
5. [Express Server](https://expressjs.com/)
6. [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/?id=luxon)\
  (Datetime management)
7. [@aws-sdk/client-s3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-sdk/client-s3)\
  (new AWS sdk for image uploading -- also optional)
8. [**Express Rate Limit**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit)\
  (for rate-limiting | see `src/middleware/auth.guards.ts`)
9.  [**Argon2**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/argon2)\
  (password encryption)


The app is written in [Typescript 5.x](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-5-3.html). 

## PLEASE NOTE
‚ö†Ô∏è This is designed for scaffolding and hacking pretty quickly. It assumes a relational database (and NOT a single table) architecture.\
Although it doesn't inherently cut any corners, please keep future scaling concerns in mind as you proceed.

## Code Helpers
Functional helpers exist for 
- Image uploading 
  - Routes in (`/server.ts`)
  - Upload handlers in (`services/aws.service.ts`)
- User authentication and registration
  - Routes in (`/server.ts` via `configurePassport`)
  - Handlers in (`services/passport.ts`, `middleware/verify.ts`)

This should be enough to get you started quickly.
