## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security vulnerabilities take a natural priority over standard bug reports and feature requests. If you
encounter an unresolved vulnerability, please create a 
[**Security Vulnerability** issue here](https://github.com/JACK-COM/prisma-express/issues/new/choose). 
Provide as much detail as you can. Your report will be prioritized as time permits.
